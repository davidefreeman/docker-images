## How to build Oracle GoldenGate for BigData on Docker
This project offers sample Dockerfile and other associated file for this build:
 * 123010_ggs_Adapters_Linux_x64.zip (Oracle GoldenGate 12c for BigData (12.3.0.1))
 * Dockerfile - Build file for Docker image
 * entrypoint.sh - steps required to install Oracle GoldenGate 12c

To rebuild the Oracle GoldenGate for BigData Docker image, use the following command:

	docker build -t oggbigdata:12.3.0.1.0 -f Dockerfile .

## Running Oracle GoldenGate for BigData in a Docker container
To run your Oracle Database Docker image use the **docker run** command as follows:

	docker run -d --name oggbd \
	-p 9500:9500 \
	oggbigdata:12.3.0.1.0

	Parameters:
	   --name:        The name of the container (default: auto generated)
	   -p:            The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
	                  Three ports are exposed:
	                  	- 9500 (OGG Manager Port (non-default))

To access Oracle GoldenGate 12c, run the following from the command line:

	$OGG_HOME/ggsci

### Running GGSCI in a Docker container
You may use the same Docker image you used to start the database, to run `sqlplus` to connect to it, for example:

	docker exec -ti <container name> ggsci

## Known issues
* The [`overlay` storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/) on CentOS has proven to run into Docker bug #25409. We recommend using `btrfs` or `overlay2` instead. For more details see issue #317.

*PATH environment variable is not set correctly after being built.  

## Support
Oracle Database in single instance configuration is supported for Oracle Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.
